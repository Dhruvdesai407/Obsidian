## the promisified version is more cleaner and neater.
## promise uses to 2 functions, `let p = new Promise(fn1);
## `function fn1(fn2) {`
## `# fn2();`
## `}`
## `p.then(callback)` 
# fn1 is supposed to be the body of the code which we have to Promisify ! fn2 is the function to be executed and if it resolves, we can move onto callback via *.then*
